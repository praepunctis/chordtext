Turn text into chords with a little AI magic.

Have you written lyrics for a song, but don't know what tune to set it to? 



tl;dr -- I'm creating a web app that uses sentiment analysis to **turn user-input lyrics into musical chords.


Here's how I tackled the sentiment analysis ML model bit:
* I leveraged the **Large Movie Review Dataset,** made publicly available by [Andrew Maas et al](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/). It contains 50,000 movie reviews mapped to scores based on the general tone of the review. This dataset was introduced in their 2011 ACL paper and is cited at the footer.
* I used some **Python** libraries (`pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `nltk`) to train a machine learning model off of this dataset. Given user-input text, the model is capable of judging its general sentiment with about 90% accuracy.

While carefully transcribing and cleaning the code, I fixed some syntax errors, import statements (after many hours of fighting Python dependencies), and authored the console outputs and all annotations within the program.
