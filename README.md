This project leverages the **Large Movie Review Dataset,** made publicly available by [Andrew Maas et al](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/). This dataset was introduced in their 2011 ACL paper:

*Andrew L. Maas, Raymond E. Daly, Peter T. Pham, Dan Huang, Andrew Y. Ng, and Christopher Potts. (2011). Learning Word Vectors for Sentiment Analysis. The 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2011).*
